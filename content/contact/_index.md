I do look for freelance work outside my day to day employment, simply because I code a ton anyways so I might as well code something useful for someone else rather than just play around with my own never-to-be-finished-projects. So if you are someone who require my expertise feel free to contact me through the form below, or through any of the social media channels listed here.

**Looking forward hearing from you!**
