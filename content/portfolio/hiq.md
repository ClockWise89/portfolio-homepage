During my time at HiQ I have worked with around 10 different clients of various sizes with projects just as varying. Since I am under a non disclosure agreement I can't really speak freely about these clients or their projects, but I am allowed to mention some of them by name: Mölnlycke Healthcare, Volvofinans bank, Volvo, Parkeringsbolaget, Göta Lejon, just to mention a few. The projects have all been towards mobile development, or in some cases internet of things, where Objective-C and Swift have been the primary focus.

For collaboration tools I have used JIRA, Hansoft, Trello, and Microsoft TFS. For distribution we have mainly used Testflight, Buddybuild, or HockeyApp. Since I have also worked closely with UX and designers I have also been in contact with Zeplin, Sketch, and Invision, even though I have never created content in these tools.

The role I have had during these projects has mostly been as a frontend developer, and in most cases the sole developer since several of the projects have only had a development cycle of a few weeks to a few months. But the two longest projects I have been a part of have each spanned about a year, where I was junior developer in one, and senior developer in the other.
