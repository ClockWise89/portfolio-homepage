Together with five others I co-founded CYBM where we were working on social platform with focus on exercise challenges and fitness. My role at CYBM was to develop the mobile application for iOS together with one of the others.

At CYBM we were working on a service, where the user could create, join, and watch recoreded responses for exercise challenges and share them with the world. We called this service OneWin and launched an app on both App Store and Google Play. Unfortunately the project did not acquire the traction needed to sustain its costs and after over two years of development we decided to close the project down and the app was removed from respective platforms. At this point I decided to leave the company and focus on other projects instead.
