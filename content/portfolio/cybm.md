CYBM is a company that I've founded together with five other people where I carry the role as one of two app developers. we also have a designer, backend developer, and two sale managers who also act as product owners and project managers.

At CYBM we are currently working with an app, or service, where the user can watch, join, or create exercise challenges and share them with friends - and the world. We call this project OneWin and it's already launched on app store with a web based version for android users. It's still a work in progress where the siix of us at CYBM put in ours when we find the time.
