CYBM is a company that co-founded together with five other people where I carried the role as one of two frontend developers.

At CYBM we were working on an app, or service, where the user could watch, join, or create exercise challenges and share them with friends - and the world. We called this project OneWin and launched an app on both App Store and Google Play. Unfortunately the project did not acquire the traction needed to sustain its costs and after over two years of development we decided to close the project down. The app was removed from respective platforms. At this point I decided to leave the company due to personal reasons, but CYBM is still very much alive with other projects.
