My first year at Sleep Cycle I worked on their time tracking app, Life Cycle, for iOS. The app tracks how and where you spend your time, and then presents it to you in a manner that makes it readable. You can see how many hours a day, a week, a month, a year, you spend at work, commuting, lunch, visiting family, traveling, biking, running, walking, the list goes on and on. Even if the focus of the app is to collect and divide your everyday into chunks of readable categories and charts, it truly shines when it finds patterns in your data. It could be something simple as telling you that on Mondays you usually enter the office at around 7.30 a.m, or something more complex like how often you visit your parents (or when you last did, if it's been a while).

After that initial year Sleep Cycle needed to add more manpower towards their sleeping app, Sleep Cycle, and I was put into a team where we work with new content and features. The app started out as an alarm clock, which captures your sleep and tries to analyze which sleep stage you are in at what time. This data makes it possible for the app to evaluate the quality of your sleep, which in turn makes it possible to predict when would be the best time to wake you up for you to feel the most rested.

Over the years the app grew to be so much more, and the last couple of years the app has exploded with features, design updates, and even complete design overhauls. The app doesn't only track your sleep anymore, but also records your snoring, presents data on your average sleeping patterns and behaviors, sleep aid with recorded stories to help you fall asleep, sleep notes where you can add information on what you've done certain days that might affect your sleep, statistics on when you went to bed, how long it took for you to fall asleep, how regular your bedtimes are, when you woke up, how much time you spent in bed, how much of that was actual sleep, and much more.

The app has truly become a tool set for your use to tackle issues with your sleep, or just keep track of it to notice deviations to your sleeping patterns - and what might have been the source for these deviations. Sleep Cycle is the most advanced sleeping app on the market with millions of daily users.
